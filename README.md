            - They must enter their existing Email in the Database.

        * After the user logs in, display the amount they have in their bank (user's choice) and offer them services:
            # Logout:
            - If the user chooses this option, they are logged out and offered the option, as at the beginning, to sign up, log in, or change the password.
            
            # Withdraw Money:
            - If the user chooses this option, they can withdraw an amount from their bank (not exceeding the available amount).
            
            # Deposit Money:
            - If the user chooses this option, they can deposit the desired amount (not exceeding 1000 dirhams).
            
            # Take a Loan:
            - If the user chooses this option, they can take a loan up to 20% of what they already have.
            - They receive an additional 20%, but lose 10% with each login until reaching the amount of their loan.
            
            # Invest:
            - If the user chooses this option, they can invest any amount in the bank.
            - Upon the next login, they will receive 20% of their investment each time until reaching 120% (earning 20% on each investment).
            
            # History:
            - Ability to view the entire transaction history.
